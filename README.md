This app is a "fancy" metronome. An opening screen provides several options:
* a 'normal' metronome, with various options for beat organization
* an 'odd-meter' metronome, which allows for different beat lengths in a measure which loops
* a 'pre-programmed' metronome, which accesses data on the web (via Firebase) to download programs to use with music that changes meter
